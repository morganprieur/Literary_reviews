## Followed threads 

1. The VSCode "Extensions" tab (found into the VSCode dashboard) 
*  Interests: 
    - It offers suitable tools for working on VSCode. 
    - The extensions are always up to date. 
    - The informations about the usage popularity are displayed at the top of the page 
    (example for Python: (Microsoft)[microsoft.com] | 107,169,708 installs | 5 stars (571) | lisense Free) 
    - All the docs are readable at the same place on the web. 

This thread doesn't be enough, but this is a easy way to find a first list of tools. 


2. (Daily.dev)[https://daily.dev/] 
*  Interests: 
    - As an Firefox extension, it is easy to use and to find. 
    - It is in english then I make progress in reading this language. 
    - It serves contents about "eco conception", that is very important for me. 

To summarize my position about the technology: 
A good technology is as light as possible, in LTS release, without useless decorations or gadgets (eco designed, in short), and only developed if its functionalities are really useful and irreplaceable. 
Daily.dev isn't probably the best, but it's close.

## Chosen technologies 

### IDE VSCode 
*  (VS Code)[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs]  
*  Reasons: 
    - I've been using it since more than 3 years. 
    Although I am using only a few of its fonctionnalities, they are enough to show to me its first interests: 
    - It's a Microsoft software, then it's easy to rely to and use GitHub, that earns to Microsoft too. 
    - The extensions system allows to get specified tools for each of the languages and/or technos that we are using. 
    - The docs are relatively complete, but the help's forums give a lot of solvings and tricks with this IDE. 
    - It's the most ever used IDE since at least 2020, and the most maintained of the Microsoft softwares. 

**After having chosen the IDE, we have to chose some extensions to work with.:** 

### Python VSCode extension 
*  (Python VSCode Extension)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python] 
*  Reasons: 
    - Helps to write Python code: It contains a lot of useful tools like auto completion, debugging, linting tools. 
    - I've already been using it. 

### Snyk VSCode extension 
*  (Snyk)[https://snyk.io/] 
*  Reasons: 
    - I need a security overview of my code. Using an extension allows to introduce to security threats, while it helps to make the code safe. 
    After using this extension, I will need to learn more about security, but the extension is very useful. 


### GitHub platform 
*  (GitHub)[https://github.com/] 
*  Reasons: 
    - This is the requested tool into the OpenClassRooms projects. 
    - I prefer the fonctionnalities and the interface of GitHub than the ones like GitLab or BitBucket, that are the most used with Git. 
    - I never have been used another versionning software. 
    - My work and side repos are on GitHub and GitLab, then I prefer work with these both websites. 
    Following my preference of "logiciels libres", I will make a repo on Framagit too, in order to search a job after this apprenticeship. 


### Django LoginView class 
*  (django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView)[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView] 
*  Reasons: 
    - This class replaces the `LoginPageView` class, if it has no specific needs. It has to be imported into `urls.py`. 


### W3CSS - light stylesheets framework 
*  (W3css)[https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/] 
*  Reasons: 
    - This CSS framework is very light, and not intrusive like Bootstrap, for example. I have already used it, in preference to Bootstrap.
