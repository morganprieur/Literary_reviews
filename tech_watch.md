## Chosen technologies 

### IDE VSCode 

*  Name/doc link: (VS Code)[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs]  
*  Reasons: 
    - I've been using it since more than 3 years. 
    Although I am using only a few of its fonctionnalities, they are enough to show to me its first interests: 
    - It's a Microsoft software, then it's easy to rely to and use GitHub, that earns to Microsoft too. 
    - The extensions system allows to get specified tools for each of the languages and/or technos that we are using. 
    - The docs are relatively complete, but the help's forums give a lot of solvings and tricks with this IDE. 
    - It's the most ever used IDE since at least 2020, and the most maintained of the Microsoft softwares. 


**After having chosen the IDE, we have to chose some extensions to work with...** 


### Python VSCode extension 
This is an extension of VSCode, to help to write Python code. 

*  Name/doc link:     
    (Python)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python] 
*  Reasons: 
    - This is a Microsoft tool too, a priori more strong and reliable with VSCode, but it is not certain. 
    - It contains a lot of tools like auto completion, debugging, linting tools. 
    - I've already been using it. 


### GitHub platform 

*  Name/doc link:     
    (GitHub)[https://github.com/] 
*  Reasons: 
    - This is the requested tool into the OpenClassRooms projects. 
    - I prefer the fonctionnalities and the interface of GitHub than the ones of GitLab or BitBucket, and they are the most used with Git. 
    - I never have been used another versionning software. 
    - My work and side repos are on GitHub and GitLab, then I prefer work with these both websites. 



### Snyk VSCode extension 

*  Name/doc link:     
    (Snyk)[https://snyk.io/] 
*  Reasons: 
    - This is an extension of VSCode IDE. 
    - I need a security overview of my code, and using an extension allow to introduce to security goals, while it makes the code safe. 
    After using this extension, I will need to learn more about security, but the extension is very useful for that. 



### SASS - stylesheets 

**TODO**
